              Hi! I'm Polina Sibiriakova, an aspiring software developer with a
              diverse background in project and account management. After
              successfully completing a Software Development Bootcamp at the
              University of British Columbia (UBC), I decided to pivot my career
              towards coding and technology. For over seven years, I honed my
              skills as a project manager, working closely with cross-functional
              teams to deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget.
              This experience has provided me with strong organizational and
              leadership skills, as well as a deep understanding of what it
              takes to successfully execute projects from start to finish.
              Additionally, my 1.5 years as an account manager taught me the
              importance of clear communication, relationship building, and
              client satisfaction.

        When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring creative hobbies
        like photography, hiking through nature, or playing the piano. I'm
        passionate about continuous learning and enjoy staying updated with the
        latest trends in technology and software development. In my downtime, I
        love contributing to open-source projects and participating in
        hackathons to sharpen my skills.
