        <p>About me</p>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Polina Sibiriakova, an aspiring software developer with a
          diverse background in project and account management. After
          successfully completing a Software Development Bootcamp at the
          University of British Columbia (UBC), I decided to pivot my career
          towards coding and technology. For over seven years, I honed my skills
          as a project manager, working closely with cross-functional teams to
          deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget. This
          experience has provided me with strong organizational and leadership
          skills, as well as a deep understanding of what it takes to
          successfully execute projects from start to finish. Additionally, my
          1.5 years as an account manager taught me the importance of clear
          communication, relationship building, and client satisfaction.

          When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring creative hobbies
